HOW TO: Select optimum values for "MasterDBRefreshInterval" and "infa.masterUpdateTimeInterval"
Solution
INFA_SolutionThe default value for infa.masterUpdateTimeInterval is 15000ms (=15s) and MasterDBRefreshInterval is 8s. For a higher resiliency to the network delays the default value can be modified. You should not modify either of the properties alone. This may cause an unstable domain.
To avoid that, perform the following inequalities while modifying the defaults:
In all the PowerCenter 9.x releases till PowerCenter 9.5.1 HotFix 2:
(4 * MasterDBRefreshInterval + 55) < (6 * infa.masterUpdateTimeInterval)
From PowerCenter 9.5.1 HotFix 2 onwards
(4 * MasterDBRefreshInterval + 45 + infa.updateMasterConnectTimeout) < (6 * infa.masterUpdateTimeInterval)
Up till PowerCenter 9.5.1 HotFix 2, instead of infa.updateMasterConnectTimeout, a hard coded value of 10 seconds is used. From PowerCenter 9.5.1 HotFix 2 (so even on 951HotFix4 ) onwards, a new property is introduced to control the Node level Greeting Exchange Response time. It can be changed using the below syntax within the Java properties.
More Information
INFA_More_InformationMasterDBRefreshInterval is a custom property that needs to be added in the domain properties.infa.masterUpdateTimeInterval and infa.updateMasterConnectTimeout need to be added in infaservices.sh by appending to the INFA_JAVA_OPTS variable.
Example
setenv INFA_JAVA_OPTS="${INFA_JAVA_OPTS} -Dinfa.masterUpdateTimeInterval=20000 -Dinfa.updateMasterConnectTimeout=15"
OR
INFA_JAVA_OPTS=${INFA_JAVA_OPTS} -Dinfa.updateMasterConnectTimeout=15  (secs)
Make a note of the following while making any changes to the configuration of above-mentioned properties:
When the properties are modified, make sure these get modified for all the nodes in the domain.
Do not set timeouts to high values, as higher values of these time would result in issues such as the following:
Delay in master gateway to detect a node failure, so the failover of the services running on those nodes can get affected
It can also result in a delay in failover of master gateway
NoteRefresh Time Interval = 4 * MasterDBRefreshInterval - multi node Domain, Default 32 seconds
Refresh Time Interval = 12 * MasterDBRefreshInterval - single node Domain, Default 96 seconds

HOW TO: Set the "MasterDBRefreshInterval" custom domain parameter from the command line
Solution
INFA_SolutionTo set the MasterDBRefreshInterval custom domain parameter from the command line:
In a Windows environment, run the following command:
INFA_HOME/isp/bin/infacmd.bat
UpdateDomainOptions -dn DomainName -un Administrator -pd Administrator -do MasterDBRefreshInterval=16
In a UNIX environment, run the following command:
$INFA_HOME/isp/bin/infacmd.sh
UpdateDomainOptions -dn DomainName -un Administrator -pd Administrator -do MasterDBRefreshInterval=16​
Note
The commands above will set MasterDbRefreshInterval to 16 seconds. The value of this custom domain property is 8 by default.​​
More Information
INFA_More_InformationRestart all the nodes of the domain for the changes to take effect.
To confirm that the changes, search for the following line in node.log:
2014-10-10 19:28:14,884 INFO  [Domain Monitor] [DOM_10142] The update and timeout properties for the master gateway node is set in the domain configuration repository. The row update interval time is set to [16000] milliseconds and the out-of-date row timeout is set to [64000] milliseconds.
Following is the general syntax of the command:
UpdateDomainOptions
<-DomainName|-dn> domain_name
<-UserName|-un> user_name
[<-Password|-pd> password]
[<-SecurityDomain|-sdn> security_domain]
[<-Gateway|-hp> gateway_host1:port gateway_host2:port...]

FAQ: What causes the domain to go down frequently even after increasing the "MasterDBRefreshInterval" and "MasterUpdateTimeInterval" values?
Answer
INFA_AnswerOne reason the domain will go down is if the domain configuration repository database has no space left in its shared pool memory. Insufficient space will lead to SQL requests/updates from the domain to not be serviced. This causes the domain to go down when the MasterDBRefreshInterval threshold is reached.
To resolve this issue, flush the shared pool memory on the Domain Configuration Repository database. The process needs to be completed by the DBA.

Node goes down frequently with error "Cannot update the data for the master gateway node" even if "MasterDBRefreshInterval" is updated
Problem Description
INFA_Problem_Description​Node goes down frequently with the following error even when MasterDBRefreshInterval is updated to a high value:
Cannot update the data for the master gateway node
A spy log has been enabled to identify the issue.
Cause
INFA_CauseFollowing is sequence of events as witnessed in the logs:
Node .log
2016-05-24 03:53:47,360 ERROR [Domain Monitor] [DOM_10095] The master gateway data in the domain configuration repository was updated during the last refresh time interval 203975.
2016-05-24 03:53:47,360 FATAL [Domain Monitor] [DOM_10094] Cannot update the data for the master gateway node [node01] within the refresh interval time [200000]. The node will not continue as a master gateway node. Verify that the connection to the domain configuration repository database is valid.
node_jsf.log

Spy.log:
spy(pool-2-thread-1225)(2016/05/24 03:51:13.015)>> Connection[1345].close()

spy(Master Elect Data Writer)(2016/05/24 03:54:13.036)>> OK
From the above details we see that there is no activity from the client to the DB for 4 minutes : (from the spy logs)
03:51:13.018 to  03:54:13.017. But at the same time in the node_jsf we see that the hostname cannot be resolved. If that is the domain database name, then we can add the host name in the /etc/hosts file and try the same for few days. ​
Solution
INFA_SolutionAfter resolving the DNS issue, or adding the host/IP details in /etc/hosts file, the domain stays stable.

Cause
INFA_Cause​This ​issue occurs if the value of MasterDBRefreshInterval is increased, but the value of MasterUpdateTimeInterval is not updated at all or is not increased enough. This can cause the node to become unstable temporarily.
Solution
INFA_SolutionTo resolve the issue, update the values of both MasterDBRefreshInterval and MasterUpdateTimeInterval based upon the following formula. You should not modify either of these two properties alone.
In all the PowerCenter 9.x releases till PowerCenter 9.5.1 HotFix 2:
(4 * MasterDBRefreshInterval + 55) < (6 * infa.masterUpdateTimeInterval)
From PowerCenter 9.5.1 HotFix 2 onwards
(4 * MasterDBRefreshInterval + 45 + infa.updateMasterConnectTimeout) < (6 * infa.masterUpdateTimeInterval)
Uptill PowerCenter 9.5.1 HotFix 2, instead of infa.updateMasterConnectTimeout, a hard coded value of 10 seconds is used. From PowerCenter 9.5.1 HotFix 2 onwards, a new property is introduced to control the Node level Greeting Exchange Response time.T
More Information
INFA_More_Information​​MasterDBRefreshInterval is a custom property that needs to be added in the domain properties.infa.masterUpdateTimeInterval and infa.updateMasterConnectTimeout need to be added in infaservices.sh by appending to the INFA_JAVA_OPTS variable.
Example
setenv INFA_JAVA_OPTS="${INFA_JAVA_OPTS} -Dinfa.masterUpdateTimeInterval=20000 -Dinfa.updateMasterConnectTimeout=15"​

ERROR: "[DTF_0001] An error occurred in the underlying transport layer... Channel is in [7] state" in versions starting Informatica 9 Services
Problem Description
INFA_Problem_DescriptionThe following error is often seen in Informatica Services version 9 onwards:
ERROR [Monitor Guaranteed Message File Thread] [LGS_10048] The following error occurred while logging to Log Service: [[LGS_10024] Log request failed due to the following error [[DTF_0001] An error occurred in the underlying transport layer: [[sendMSG]: Channel is in [7] state.]].].\ncom.informatica.isp.corecommon.exceptions.ISPException: [LGS_10024] Log request failed due to the following error [[DTF_0001] An error occurred in the underlying transport layer: [[sendMSG]: Channel is in [7] state.]].
Cause
INFA_CauseThis issue is often related to network issues between PowerCenter server and the domain database.
Solution
INFA_SolutionTo resolve this issue, increase the refresh time interval of the domain so that it can sustain minor network errors.Set the MasterDBRefreshInterval custom parameter as follows:
Login to the Administration Console.
Click on the Domain on the left-hand navigation.
On the right-hand Navigation, click on Properties.
Scroll to the bottom of the Properties page and edit the Custom Properties.Under Properties, go to Custom Properties > Edit.
Specify the parameter name MasterDBRefreshInterval and the value in seconds (60 or larger is recommended). For instance, MasterDBRefreshInterval=60
Click OK.
Restart the domain.
This value will increase the refresh interval to 60 seconds. The default value is 8 seconds.
More Information
INFA_More_Information​​If MasterDBRefreshInterval is set to 60, then MasterUpdateTimeInterval value should be updated accordingly because the following equation should be stratified:
In all the PowerCenter 9.x releases till PowerCenter 9.5.1 HotFix 2:
( 4 * MasterDBRefreshInterval + 55) < (6 * infa.masterUpdateTimeInterval )
From PowerCenter 9.5.1 HotFix 2 onwards:
( 4 * MasterDBRefreshInterval + 45 + infa.updateMasterConnectTimeout) < (6 * infa.masterUpdateTimeInterval )

FAQ: Which is the Code Page used by PowerExchange for Amazon Redshift connector in PowerCenter?
Answer
INFA_AnswerThe input data to the Amazon Redshift could only contain UTF-8 characters up to four bytes long. So, by default PowerExchange for Amazon Redshift connector uses the UTF-8 as the code page and sends data in UTF-8 format.
Amazon Redshift connection in Workflow Manager shows code page as MS Windows Latin and it is grayed out.
The code page shown in the Redshift connection in Workflow Manager could be safely ignored.
